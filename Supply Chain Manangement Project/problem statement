Title
"Optimizing Supply Chain Management using Machine Learning to Address Supply Chain Disruptions in Instant Noodles Delivery"

Business Problem Statement
An FMCG company entered into the instant noodles business two years back. Their higher management has noticed that there is a miss match in the demand and supply. Where the demand is high, supply is pretty low and where the demand is low, supply is pretty high. In both ways, it is an inventory cost loss to the company; hence, the higher management wants to optimize the supply quantity in every warehouse in the entire country.

Goal & Objectives
This exercise aims to build a model, using historical data that will determine the optimum weight of the product to be shipped each time to the warehouse.

Also, try to analyze the demand pattern in different pockets of the country so management can drive the advertisement campaign, particularly in those pockets.

This is the first phase of the agreement; hence, the company has shared very limited information. Once you are able to showcase a tangible impact with this much information then the company will open the 360-degree data lake for your consulting company to build a more robust model.
